## What has been done?

✅ Tame the data

✅ Sort with name/price asc des.

✅ A fine toppings filter

✅ Somewhat responsive

✅ Magic card hover

✅ Looking good coding structure

## What is missing?

🤦‍♂️no sidebar when screen is too small (I want to make the side-bar become a nav-bar for small device but need more time due to my weird css skills)

♿sidebar behaves a bit wild
