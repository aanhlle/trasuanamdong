## What has been done?

✅ Tame the data
✅ Sort with name/price asc des.
✅ A fine toppings filter
✅ Somewhat responsive
✅ Magic card hover
✅ Looking good coding structure

## What is missing?

🤦‍♂️no sidebar when screen is too small (I want to make the side-bar become a nav-bar for small device but need more time due to my weird css skills)
♿sidebar behaves a bit wild
